The file "scale.py" create plots of u_crit, Q_crit and Re as a function of the pipe diameter H. It uses the 3" pipe data from script "roughness.py" to estimate the critical wall shear stress.

The file "roughness.py" estimates the wall roughness from 3" and 4" pipe data, using the Colebrook equation.
